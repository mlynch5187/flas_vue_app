## My First Python Flask Vue App

### Objectives

As a recent graduate of the Turing School of Software and Design, my primary objective is to continue challenging
myself with new programming languages. I also want to expand my base of knowledge when it comes to using microservices,
and being a backend-focused graduate I also want to learn more about working on the frontend.

### What Is It?
In this app the user will be able to add books to a book collection, update
these books, and delete these books. This is my first attempt at building a Python CRUD app. 
It is also the first time I am using Flask as a microservice. Previously I had only used 
the Sinatra microservice with Ruby on Rails. Vue is also completely new to me.
